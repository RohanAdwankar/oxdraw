The frontend needs to be changed over to Next.js
I have initiated a placeholder project in the `frontend` directory
The goal is to bring over the diagram editor functionality
This will allow the frontend to call the Rust backend via API calls
Then the frontend should enable modifications to the digram
These modifications should update to create the new diagram files which describe the modifications at the end of the file
